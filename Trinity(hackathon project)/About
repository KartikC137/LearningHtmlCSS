This is a website created and submitted for a hackathon by me and @manas202. 

The topic to create a website was "Your vision of future".
Our idea was to develop a website of a hypothetical company which provides service to farmers in future. They use advanced technologies like satellites and robots. 
This website allows farmeres to login and check their profile, which includes necessary insights of their land.
