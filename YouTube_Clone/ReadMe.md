This is a simple project I created while learning HTML and CSS following a course on youtube.com [linked below]

Usage: Run the YouTube-clone.html file inside the /HTML folder

Key points:
>The Website is built with reference to the older youtube.com website,not an exact clone and only compatible with Light/White mode.
>I added custom styling to header[backround blur] and a custom profile-preview-box which is displayed when hovered over channel profile picture.
>The Website is not responsive yet.
>I am going to continue practicing some more concepts over this project.

Continuation:
>I will add all the video previews and try to add proper icons with transparent backgrounds.
>Make the website responsive.
>slide-in slide-out hamburger menu.
>Dark mode compatible.
